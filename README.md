# BTQ - Brampton Tennis Queue

Our objective is to build an online queue system for local tennis courts in Brampton with real-time notifications, no-shows, and dynamic buffer time tracking. The system should prioritize ease of use, especially for elderly people, and ensure privacy and data security. We are working with the City of Brampton's recreation team to launch this app in local courts by Summer 2025!

# Useful Git Commands / Workflow
- **`git clone <repo link>`**: Clone the repo to your computer. Click the green "Code" button and copy the link under the "HTTPS" section.  
- **`git checkout -b <branch name>`**: Create a new branch with the specified name. All of your changes for a specific ticket should be made here! Example name: `add-profile-page`.  
- **`git pull origin main`**: Pull changes from the main branch into your current branch. It's a good practice to do this regularly to stay updated.  
- **`git status`**: This command shows the current state of changes. It should be done before and after using `git add`.  
- **`git add .` / `git add <file name>`**: Use `git add .` to stage all files or `git add <file name>` to stage a specific file.  
- **`git commit -m "Describe what was changed"`**: Commit your changes with a detailed message that describes what was changed.  
- **`git push origin <branch name>`**: Push your changes to the branch on GitHub. You must specify the branch name because GitHub won’t know which branch you’re referring to.  
- **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the repo page and click "New Pull Request". You will need at least one review to merge into the main branch.
